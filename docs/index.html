  <h1>Welcome to Alex Sui's Website!</h1>
  <h3>First here are some things that you should know about me:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> I enjoy competitive programming and learning about AI. I was never really into coding until I was introduced to Scratch back in 3rd grade. After that, I learned Python as a main language but quickly changed my main language to C++ since I thought it would increase peformance.</li>
    <li> I enjoy playing USTA and UTR official tennis tournaments, but I only enjoy it when I win. :P</li>
    <li> I do AMC, MIC, and Math Kangeroo math competitions, but I was never really good at it.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have played the piano for 6 years and I am currently trying to pass ABRSM Grade 8.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p> So! You learned a bit about me. But what's the point of this website, Alex? Well, the point of this website is basically to put news about me. e.g Tennis match scores, acomplishments, etc</p>
